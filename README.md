# Applied Algorithms
Some work / projects I did for [Dr. Gelfond](http://redwood.cs.ttu.edu/~mgelfond) and his [Applied Algorithms](http://redwood.cs.ttu.edu/~mgelfond/FALL-2012/slides.pdf) course at Texas Tech University.

## Purpose
Each folder is dedicated to a type of algorithm, and each folder has educational pieces of what that algorithm is, its purpose, the concepts behind it, as well as a solution with graphical representation written in Python.
